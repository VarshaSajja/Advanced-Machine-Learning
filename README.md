**Research Area : ** 
How does mental illness identified from the past, such as family history/previous health, relate to the current disorder of a person?

**Results : **
This research question investigates and dives into the below survey questions/variables for analysing the origin of mental health disorder in a tech employee.
  1. Do you have a family history of mental illness?
  2. Have you had a mental health disorder in the past?
  3. Do you currently have a mental health disorder?
  4. If you have a mental health issue, do you feel that it interferes with your work when being treated effectively? 

**Conclusion : **
In an attempt to determine the history of mental illness is related to current mental health disorder, the machine learning algorithms such as Linear regression, Decision trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and kNN classification has been performed. 
In Linear regression, it is proven that the history of mental illness is the key factor in determining the current mental health of a person. This model performed best than all other models in determining the current mental health of a person. 
To achieve higher accuracy of the data (74% train accuracy and 72% test accuracy), I used other techniques which gave unclear results with low accuracy. From this, it is clear that the survey needs to be appropriate enough to analyze the data further with the entire questionnaire in predicting the factors contributing to the mental health disorder of tech employees.
